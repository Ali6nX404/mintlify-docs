This is your control center where you can view system-wide metrics, manage your AI agents, access chat logs, and configure settings.

## Dashboard Overview

This screen gives you a high-level view of how your AI agents are performing:

![Botric Main Dashboard](../images/quickStart/main_dashboard.png)


| **Title** | **Description** |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Active Agents** | Number of AI agents currently active in your workspace. |
| **Token Used** | Total tokens consumed across all conversations, useful for tracking usage. |
| **Total Messages** | Number of messages exchanged between users and agents. |
| **Conversation Trends** | A visual graph that shows how conversations are growing over time, along with total conversation volume and resolution percentage. |
| **Conversation Categories** | Breakdown of agent responses by category (e.g., confident answers, support requests). |
| **Visitor Distribution by Country** | This visual chart shows where your users are coming from, giving you geographic insights for audience targeting. |

## Why Data Might Be Empty

If you're seeing messages like ‚Äú_No conversation data yet_‚Äù or ‚Äú_No country data available_,‚Äù don‚Äôt worry! This is expected if your agent hasn‚Äôt started interacting with users yet. Once conversations begin, data will appear here automatically.

Think of this dashboard as your support control room. The more conversations your AI agent handles, the more this space transforms into a rich data source, perfect for analyzing performance, identifying gaps, and improving customer experience.

Now that you‚Äôre familiar with the dashboard, it‚Äôs time to bring your first AI Chat Agent to life.
